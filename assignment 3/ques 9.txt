void main(){
   
  // Let user give first number and second number
 var firstnumber = 10;
 var secondnumber = 5;
  
 // Let user now give operation between 2 inputs in calculator
  
  var operation = '*';
  
  if (operation == '+'){
    print (firstnumber+secondnumber);  
  }
  else if(operation == "-"){
    print(firstnumber-secondnumber);
  }
  else if(operation == "*"){
    print(firstnumber*secondnumber);
  }
  else if(operation == "/"){
    print(firstnumber/secondnumber);
  }
  else if(operation == "%"){
    print(firstnumber%secondnumber);
  }
